<p>NoSQL, or "not only SQL," is a category of database management systems (DBMS) that diverges from the traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) model. Unlike RDBMS, which relies on a structured schema and SQL (Structured Query Language) for data manipulation, NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data.</p>
<br>
<h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Schema-less:</b> NoSQL databases are often schema-less, allowing flexibility in storing and managing various data types without a predefined schema.
</li>
<li><b>Scalability:</b> NoSQL databases are well-suited for horizontal scaling, making it easier to distribute data across multiple servers and handle large volumes of data.
</li>
<li><b>Performance:</b> Many NoSQL databases excel in performance for specific use cases, such as high read and write throughput, making them suitable for applications with demanding performance requirements.
</li>
<li><b>Types of NoSQL Databases:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Document Stores:</b> Store data in flexible, JSON-like documents (e.g., MongoDB).
</li>
<li><b>Key-Value Stores:</b> Simple key-value pairs, efficient for high-throughput read and write operations (e.g., Redis).
</li>
<li><b>Column-family Stores:</b> Organize data in columns rather than rows, optimized for read and write performance (e.g., Apache Cassandra).
</li>
<li><b>Graph Databases:</b> Model and store data as nodes, edges, and properties, suitable for complex relationships (e.g., Neo4j).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Use Cases:</h3>
<p>NoSQL databases are often employed in scenarios where rapid development, horizontal scalability, and flexibility in handling diverse data types are crucial. Common use cases include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Real-time Big Data Applications:</b> NoSQL databases can handle large volumes of data with low-latency requirements, making them suitable for real-time analytics and big data applications.
</li>
<li><b>Content Management Systems:</b> NoSQL databases are effective for managing and serving dynamic content, accommodating changes in data structure without disrupting operations.
</li>
<li><b>Internet of Things (IoT):</b> With the ability to handle large amounts of diverse data, NoSQL databases are well-suited for IoT applications that generate a continuous stream of data.
